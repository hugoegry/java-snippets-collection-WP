Parte 02 : OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
====================================================================

This module introduces Object Oriented Programming through the Gecko class.
Exercises progressively build key OOP principles:
  - Class definition and object instantiation;
  - Constructors with and without parameters;
  - Attributes and methods (visibility, getters, setters);
  - Method overloading (hello, eat, work, fraternize);
  - State management (energy, age, name);
  - Control structures (switch) and basic polymorphism;
  - Object interaction (Gecko ↔ Gecko, Gecko ↔ Snake).

Each exercise extends the Gecko class with new behavior:
  Ex01 → Create a class and display a welcome message.
  Ex02 → Add a constructor with name handling and default value.
  Ex03 → Encapsulate the name and add a getter method.
  Ex04 → Add an age attribute with getter/setter and status() logic.
  Ex05 → Overload hello() to react to string or integer input.
  Ex06 → Implement eat() with energy management and boundaries.
  Ex07 → Add work() depending on energy level.
  Ex08 → Implement fraternize() for Gecko and Snake interactions.

Strict rules:
  - Do NOT use packages.
  - Commit only .java files, never .class files.
  - One class per file, named exactly like the file.
  - Follow prototypes, signatures, and expected outputs precisely.
  - Always print a newline after each output.
